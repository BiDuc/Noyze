Developed with love by [Tom Barrasso](http://barrasso.me). Noyze is a volume panel replacement for
Android 4.3+. It uses [Accessibility](https://developer.android.com/design/patterns/accessibility.html)
to override how the system responds to the volume buttons. It responds by presenting a
heads-up display (popup window) with information about the current volume level(s).  

Additionally, Noyze offers refined control over how volume buttons look and behave. It comes pre-built with a number of themes and settings as well as music controls. Noyze solves the problem of a volume panel that only gets in the way. It also allows you to pick a style that fits your current setup.
